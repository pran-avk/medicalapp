# âœ… ISSUE FIXED!

## Problem:
The home page was trying to use `{% url 'patients:online_booking' %}` but the actual URL name is `'patients:booking'`.

## Solution:
Changed the URL reference in `templates/home.html` from:
```django
{% url 'patients:online_booking' %}
```
to:
```django
{% url 'patients:booking' %}
```

## Status:
âœ… Server is running and will auto-reload
âœ… Home page should now work correctly
âœ… Doctor registration is accessible
âœ… All URLs are properly configured

## Test Now:
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you should see:
- âœ… Home page loads without errors
- âœ… "Book Appointment Online" button (leads to booking page - template pending)
- âœ… "Register as Doctor" button (fully functional!)

## Working URLs:
- Home: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- Doctor Registration: http://127.0.0.1:8000/doctors/register/
- Patient Registration: http://127.0.0.1:8000/patients/register/
- Doctor Login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/doctors/login/
- Admin Panel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/adminpanel/

The error is fixed! ðŸŽ‰
