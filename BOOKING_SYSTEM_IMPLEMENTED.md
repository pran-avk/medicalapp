# 🎉 NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED - Online Booking & QR System

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Changes (Migration Applied)
**New fields added to Queue model:**
- `is_online_booking` - Boolean to track online vs walk-in
- `qr_code` - Unique QR code for each booking
- `booked_at` - Timestamp when booking was made
- `arrived_at` - Timestamp when patient scanned QR at hospital
- `preferred_doctor` - Patient can choose preferred doctor
- `booking_date` - Date for which booking is made
- `booking_time_slot` - Preferred time slot (e.g., "09:00-10:00")

**New status options:**
- `booked` - Patient booked from home (not in queue yet)
- `arrived` - Patient scanned QR at reception
- `waiting` - In active queue (waiting for consultation)

### 2. Booking Service Created (`patients/booking_service.py`)
**Features:**
- ✅ Generate unique QR codes with UUID
- ✅ Create online bookings from home
- ✅ Activate bookings via QR scan at hospital
- ✅ Check booking status
- ✅ Cancel bookings
- ✅ Get available time slots
- ✅ Prevent duplicate bookings for same date

**Key Methods:**
```python
booking_service.create_online_booking()  # Book from home
booking_service.activate_booking_by_qr() # Scan at hospital
booking_service.get_booking_details()    # Check status
booking_service.cancel_booking()         # Cancel
booking_service.get_available_time_slots() # See available slots
```

### 3. Booking API Endpoints Created
**New API routes:**
- `POST /patients/api/booking/create/` - Create online booking
- `GET /patients/api/booking/{id}/` - Get booking details
- `POST /patients/api/booking/{id}/cancel/` - Cancel booking
- `POST /patients/api/booking/qr-scan/` - Activate booking via QR
- `GET /patients/api/booking/slots/{dept_id}/` - Get available slots
- `GET /patients/api/department/{dept_id}/doctors/` - Get department doctors

### 4. New Pages to Create (Templates Needed)
**Template files to create:**
1. `templates/patients/booking.html` - Online booking form
2. `templates/patients/booking_confirmation.html` - Show QR code after booking
3. `templates/patients/qr_scanner.html` - Hospital reception QR scanner

## 📋 How the New System Works

### Patient Journey - Online Booking:

1. **Book from Home** (Before visiting hospital)
   - Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/patients/booking/
   - Fill form: Name, Phone, Department, Preferred Doctor, Date, Time Slot
   - Submit booking
   - Receive QR code (save/print/screenshot)
   - **Status:** `booked` (not in queue yet)

2. **Arrive at Hospital** (On booking day)
   - Go to reception desk
   - Show QR code (on phone or printed)
   - Reception scans QR
   - System assigns token number
   - **Status:** `waiting` (now in active queue)

3. **Wait for Turn**
   - Token appears in doctor's queue
   - Doctor can see all waiting patients
   - Get notified when turn approaches

### Patient Journey - Walk-in (Old Flow - Still Works):

1. **Walk into Hospital**
   - Visit registration desk
   - Fill form and get token immediately
   - **Status:** `waiting` (directly in queue)

2. **Wait for Turn**
   - Same process as online booking

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Create Booking Page Template

Create `templates/patients/booking.html` with:
- Department selection dropdown
- Doctor selection (filtered by department)
- Date picker (today + next 7 days)
- Time slot selection
- Patient information form
- Submit button

### Step 2: Create Booking Confirmation Page

Create `templates/patients/booking_confirmation.html` with:
- Display QR code (large, centered)
- Booking details (token, department, doctor, date, time)
- Instructions: "Scan this QR at hospital reception"
- Download/Print buttons
- Add to calendar button

### Step 3: Create QR Scanner Page

Create `templates/patients/qr_scanner.html` with:
- Camera access for QR scanning
- Manual QR code input field
- Scan button
- Success/error messages
- Display activated token details

### Step 4: Update Home Page

Add "Book Appointment" button to home page linking to booking flow

### Step 5: Fix Doctor Dashboard

Ensure doctor dashboard shows:
- Both online bookings (after QR scan) AND walk-ins
- Current SQL query already correct (status='waiting')
- Just need to verify data is populating

## 🔧 Technical Details

### QR Code Format:
```
SMARTQUEUE:BOOKING:{booking_id}:{random_uuid}
Example: SMARTQUEUE:BOOKING:123:a3f7d2e1
```

### Booking Flow State Machine:
```
Online Booking:
booked → (QR scan) → waiting → called → in_consultation → completed

Walk-in:
waiting → called → in_consultation → completed
```

### Database Schema:
```sql
Queue Table (Updated):
- is_online_booking: BOOLEAN
- qr_code: VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
- booked_at: DATETIME
- arrived_at: DATETIME  
- preferred_doctor_id: FK
- booking_date: DATE
- booking_time_slot: VARCHAR(20)
- status: ENUM (booked, arrived, waiting, called, in_consultation, completed, cancelled)
```

## 🎯 Benefits of New System

## 📊 Database Migration Status

✅ **Migration Applied:** `0002_queue_arrived_at_queue_booked_at_queue_booking_date_and_more.py`

All new fields added to database successfully.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

✅ QR codes are unique and non-guessable (UUID-based)
