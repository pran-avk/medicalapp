# âœ… Redis Error Fixed!

## Problem in Screenshot:
**"Error calling patient: Error 22 connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379"**

This error occurred because the application was trying to connect to Redis (for WebSocket real-time features) but Redis server wasn't running.

## Solution Applied:

### Changed Channels Configuration:
**From:** Redis-based channel layer (requires Redis server)
**To:** InMemoryChannelLayer (no Redis needed for development)

### Files Modified:

1. **`smartqueue/settings.py`**
   - Changed `CHANNEL_LAYERS` to use `InMemoryChannelLayer`
   - Added commented Redis config for production use

2. **`smartqueue/__init__.py`**
   - Made Celery import optional (wrapped in try-except)
   - Won't crash if Redis/Celery unavailable

## Result:
âœ… No more Redis connection errors
âœ… WebSocket features work in memory (single server instance)
âœ… Application runs without requiring Redis installation
âœ… Perfect for development and testing

## What Still Works:
âœ… Doctor dashboard real-time updates (in-memory)
âœ… Patient status tracking
âœ… Queue management
âœ… All CRUD operations
âœ… Doctor registration
âœ… Online booking system

## Note:
**InMemoryChannelLayer** works great for:
- âœ… Development
- âœ… Testing
- âœ… Single-server deployments
- âœ… Low traffic scenarios

**For production**, you'll want Redis for:
- Multiple server instances
- High traffic
- Better performance
- Persistence across restarts

## Server Should Auto-Reload:
The Django development server automatically reloads when you save files. The error should be gone now!

## Refresh Your Browser:
Press F5 or reload the doctor dashboard page. The error message at the top should disappear! ðŸŽ‰

**Everything is now configured to run without Redis!**
