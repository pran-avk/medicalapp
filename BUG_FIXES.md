# SmartQueue - Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Favicon (404 Error)
**Problem:** Browser was requesting `/favicon.ico` which didn't exist.

**Solution:**
- Created SVG favicon at `static/img/favicon.svg`
- Updated `templates/base.html` to include favicon link
- Added `{% load static %}` directive to base template

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/base.html` - Added favicon link
- `static/img/favicon.svg` - Created new SVG favicon with "Q" logo

### 2. Patient Registration API 400 Error
**Problem:** Registration API was returning 400 Bad Request error.

**Solution:**
- Added detailed validation for required fields
- Added debug logging to track incoming data
- Added explicit department validation with helpful error messages
- Improved error response messages

**Files Modified:**
- `patients/views.py` - Enhanced `PatientRegistrationView.post()` method with:
  - Debug print statements
  - Department existence check before registration
  - Better error messages
  - Field validation improvements

### 3. Debug Tools Added
**Purpose:** To help diagnose registration issues.

**New Files Created:**
- `templates/patients/debug.html` - Debug page with:
  - List of available departments
  - Test registration form
  - Real-time API testing
  - Console logging

**Files Modified:**
- `patients/urls.py` - Added debug page route
- `patients/views.py` - Added `debug_page()` view

## How to Test the Fixes

### Test 1: Favicon
1. Visit any page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/patients/register/
2. Check browser tab - you should see the "Q" favicon
3. No more 404 errors in console for favicon.ico

### Test 2: Debug Page
1. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/patients/debug/
2. View list of available departments
3. Use the test form to register a patient
4. Check console output for detailed debug info

### Test 3: Registration
1. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/patients/register/
2. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Test Patient
   - Phone: 1234567890
   - Select a department
3. Click "Get Token"
4. Should receive token successfully

## Debug Output Location

When registration is attempted, you'll see debug output in the terminal:
```
DEBUG - Registration data received: {...}
DEBUG - Department ID: X
DEBUG - Found department: Department Name
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Department is required"
**Cause:** department_id not sent or empty
**Fix:** Ensure department dropdown has a value selected

### Issue: "Department with ID X not found or inactive"
**Cause:** Invalid department ID or department is inactive
**Fix:** 
1. Visit debug page to see valid department IDs
2. Ensure department is active in admin panel

### Issue: "Patient already has an active token for today"
**Cause:** Patient with same phone number already registered today
**Fix:** 
1. Use different phone number
2. Or complete/cancel existing token first
3. Or wait until next day

## Next Steps

1. **Test the debug page** - http://127.0.0.1:8000/patients/debug/
2. **Check terminal output** - Look for DEBUG messages
3. **Test registration** - Try registering with the form
4. **Check browser console** - Press F12 to see JavaScript errors

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Messages**: All API endpoints now return clear, actionable error messages
2. **Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for all required fields
3. **Debug Logging**: Added console.log and print statements for troubleshooting
4. **Department Check**: Explicit check before attempting registration
